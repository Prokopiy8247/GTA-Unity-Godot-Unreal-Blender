# GPT-6 Astra — Unreal Engine 5 + Blender MCP Realistic GTA-Style Open-World Benchmark

## Mission

You are the sole lead developer and technical artist of the **existing Unreal Engine 5 project in the currently opened Codex Desktop folder**.

Your task is to build the most complete, polished, realistic **GTA-style single-player open-world sandbox** you can achieve during this autonomous development session.

This is **not** a mission/story game. There must be **no campaign, no quests, no mission markers, no scripted story missions, and no progression gated behind missions**.

The game should launch directly into **free roam** and focus on emergent sandbox gameplay:
- exploring a large open world on foot;
- stealing/entering/driving vehicles;
- cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and airplanes;
- using many weapon types;
- fighting NPCs and police;
- committing crimes that escalate a wanted/pursuit system;
- interacting with shops and useful world locations;
- swimming;
- vehicle damage and explosions;
- traffic and pedestrians;
- day/night and weather;
- unrestricted sandbox experimentation.

The experience should reproduce as many of the **general open-world sandbox capabilities associated with games such as GTA V** as practical, while being an **original game**.

Quality references such as **GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 are visual/interaction quality bars only**. Do not copy their maps, code, missions, characters, names, logos, textures, audio, UI artwork, story content, proprietary assets, or ripped game files.

The final game must be an original project.

## Unreal Engine 5 implementation target

Use the existing **Unreal Engine 5** project and the exact installed stable UE5 version detected on this machine.

Technical defaults:

- **C++** is the primary runtime gameplay language.
- Use **Blueprints** where they improve iteration, animation, UI or designer-facing composition, but do not make the project depend on me manually wiring Blueprint graphs.
- Use **Unreal Editor Python**, Editor Utility workflows, commandlets and project-owned automation to create/configure assets and editor content reproducibly.
- **Enhanced Input** for player controls.
- **World Partition** for the large open world whenever compatible with the existing project.
- **HLOD**, streaming sources, data layers and level-instance-style workflows where useful.
- **Mass Entity / Mass AI** is encouraged for large pedestrian/traffic crowds if it materially improves scalability; otherwise use a simpler pooled Actor-based architecture.
- **Chaos Vehicles** / Chaos physics for vehicles and physical interactions where suitable.
- **Navigation System**, NavMesh, AI Controllers, Behavior Trees/State Trees, EQS or Mass processors where appropriate.
- **Niagara** for high-value VFX.
- **Lumen** for dynamic GI/reflections where practical.
- **Nanite** for suitable static environment assets where it improves quality/performance.
- **Virtual Shadow Maps** or another high-quality shadow solution appropriate to the detected UE version.
- **PCG Framework**, Splines, Geometry Script or Editor automation for large-scale world dressing/roads where useful.
- **UMG/CommonUI-style** workflows for HUD/menus where appropriate.
- **Control Rig**, IK Rig/Retargeter, Animation Blueprints and Montages for characters/creatures where useful.
- Data Assets/Data Tables/Gameplay Tags for data-driven systems where they simplify the architecture.

Do not make the entire project Blueprint-only. Keep core runtime systems, data architecture, streaming, vehicle framework, wanted system, save system and heavy logic in clean C++ where practical.

Do not require paid marketplace plugins or paid asset packs.

# 0. Existing project and mandatory Blender connection

---

# 0. Existing project and mandatory Blender connection

Work directly in the current Unreal Engine 5 project containing the `.uproject` file. **Do not create another nested Unreal project.**

A Blender file for this Unreal Engine project already exists:

```text
UnrealGTA.blend
```

The dedicated Blender MCP server for this project is:

```text
blender_unreal
```

It connects to the Blender instance on:

```text
localhost:9878
```

## Critical Blender routing rule

For this project:

- use **only** the MCP server `blender_unreal`;
- use the Blender instance on port **9878**;
- use `UnrealGTA.blend` as the canonical Blender working file for this project;
- do **not** use `blender_unity`;
- do **not** use `blender_godot`;
- do not modify Blender files belonging to the other engine projects.

Before making major Blender changes, verify that the connected Blender scene is the intended Unreal GTA asset scene.

Keep `UnrealGTA.blend` saved regularly.

You may create automatic backups or split-out source `.blend` files if genuinely necessary for stability, but `UnrealGTA.blend` remains the master Blender scene for the Unreal Engine benchmark.

---

# 1. Blender MCP is mandatory

Blender MCP is a **required active part of the 3D asset-production pipeline**, not an optional extra.

Use `blender_unreal` actively to:

- inspect the Blender scene;
- create meshes;
- edit geometry;
- create UVs;
- create materials;
- build rigs where useful;
- create basic animations where practical;
- position pivots/origins correctly;
- prepare LOD-friendly geometry;
- create collision helper meshes when useful;
- create render/viewport previews;
- inspect visible results;
- revise poor-looking assets;
- save source Blender work;
- export engine-ready assets;
- integrate them into Unreal Engine.

Do not merely write Blender Python scripts and leave them unused if the MCP can perform and verify the operation directly.

Do not ask me to manually model, UV, rig, export, import, or wire important assets.

## Blender visual QA loop

For every important hero asset:

1. inspect the current Blender scene;
2. model or modify the asset through `blender_unreal`;
3. create appropriate materials/UVs;
4. inspect it visually using Blender viewport/render feedback when available;
5. revise it if it looks visibly poor, broken, toy-like, or placeholder-quality;
6. save the Blender source;
7. export it in an engine-friendly format, preferably FBX for rigged/animated assets and FBX/GLB where appropriate for static assets;
8. import it into Unreal Engine;
9. configure materials, colliders, physics and gameplay components;
10. test it in the actual game.

A Blender asset is **not finished merely because a file exists**. It must work and look reasonable inside Unreal Engine.

---

# 2. No external asset shortcuts

This benchmark is about **GPT-6 Astra + Unreal Engine 5 + Blender MCP**.

Do not depend on:
- Unreal Marketplace/Fab asset packs;
- ripped GTA assets;
- Sketchfab;
- Poly Haven downloaded asset packs;
- Poly Pizza;
- Meshy;
- Rodin;
- Hunyuan 3D;
- external 3D generation services;
- copyrighted commercial asset packs;
- downloaded character/vehicle/weapon models.

Create the important project-specific 3D assets yourself with Blender MCP and project-owned code.

Built-in Unreal Engine functionality, built-in plugins, engine modules, and project-owned C++/Blueprint/Python content are allowed.

Procedurally generated project-owned textures, materials, meshes and audio are allowed.

---

# 3. Autonomy and workflow

I am an Unreal Engine beginner.

Do **not** expect me to manually:
- create levels, Actors, Blueprints, Components, or assets manually;
- assemble Blueprint classes or actor hierarchies manually;
- assign Unreal Editor Details-panel references manually;
- set up render settings;
- build UI;
- create materials;
- rig vehicles;
- configure weapons;
- set up NavMeshBoundsVolumes, AI Controllers, Behavior Trees, State Trees, Mass processors, or navigation data manually;
- create traffic routes;
- set up Blender exports;
- repair compile errors.

Take ownership of the implementation.

Before substantial work:

1. inspect the entire Unreal project and locate/read the `.uproject` file;
2. detect the exact installed Unreal Engine 5 version and project modules/plugins;
3. identify the current render pipeline;
4. identify installed packages;
5. inspect the existing `UnrealGTA.blend`;
6. confirm access to `blender_unreal`;
7. create a concise technical plan;
8. create/update `.gitignore`;
9. initialize Git and create a baseline commit if Git is available and the project is not already under version control;
10. create:
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
   - `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`
   - `ASTRA_FINAL_REPORT.md`
11. record a local session start timestamp.

Then work autonomously.

Do not stop and ask for confirmation after each subsystem.

If one feature becomes a deep blocker:
- preserve the working game;
- document the limitation;
- move to another high-value feature;
- return later if possible.

Do not claim an unfinished feature is working.

---

# 4. Overall design target

Create an original modern urban/crime open-world sandbox with:

- realistic visual direction;
- third-person character control;
- optional first-person mode if practical;
- large seamless-feeling map;
- realistic urban and natural environments;
- dense traffic and pedestrians;
- drivable land, air and water vehicles;
- combat;
- police response;
- wanted levels;
- shops;
- garages;
- weapon inventory;
- vehicle ownership/spawning for testing;
- day/night;
- weather;
- dynamic world reactions;
- explosions;
- physics;
- free-roam sandbox tools.

There must be **no mission system**.

The default experience is:

```text
Launch game
→ load/open world
→ control player immediately
→ freely explore and cause/interact with sandbox systems
```

---

# 5. Realistic visual target — extremely important

The target is **realistic modern 3D**, not:
- Minecraft;
- Roblox;
- voxel art;
- PS1/PS2 low-poly nostalgia;
- cartoon;
- toy-like proportions;
- flat-shaded primitives;
- generic capsules/cubes as final assets.

Aim for a visual impression inspired by modern realistic AAA open-world games.

This does **not** mean you must reach true GTA V/RDR2 production quality with one autonomous agent. It means every visual decision should move in that direction.

Prioritize:
- believable human proportions;
- realistic vehicle proportions;
- PBR materials;
- physically plausible roughness/metallic values;
- high-quality lighting;
- proper shadows;
- believable road surfaces;
- glass;
- metal;
- concrete;
- asphalt;
- vegetation;
- atmospheric fog;
- reflections where supported;
- detailed hero assets;
- consistent art direction;
- realistic color grading;
- strong weather/time-of-day presentation.

Avoid visually obvious prototype content in the final pass.

---

# 6. Unreal Engine 5 rendering and visual pipeline

Inspect the actual project settings first.

For this realism target, prioritize the strongest practical UE5 desktop rendering setup.

Preferred baseline:

- Lumen Global Illumination;
- Lumen reflections where practical;
- Virtual Shadow Maps;
- Nanite for suitable environment/prop meshes;
- physically plausible exposure;
- volumetric fog;
- atmospheric sky;
- realistic local lighting;
- high-quality post processing;
- decals;
- reflection captures where they still add value;
- high-quality water material/system;
- material instances with consistent PBR values;
- emissive lighting/signage;
- realistic nighttime lighting;
- wet-surface variants during rain.

Use Substrate only if the installed engine version/project configuration supports it reliably and it improves materials without destabilizing the project.

Do not enable expensive features blindly. The game must remain playable while recording.

Build a coherent master-material strategy:
- asphalt;
- concrete;
- painted metal;
- bare metal;
- glass;
- rubber;
- skin;
- hair;
- fabric;
- leather;
- wood;
- vegetation;
- water;
- dirt/sand/rock;
- emissive lights/signage.

Use Material Instances and parameter collections where they improve scalability.


---

# 7. Large open world

The map must feel **large, varied and worth exploring**.

Do not create a tiny square city block and call it an open world.

Create multiple distinct regions.

High-priority world regions:

1. **Dense downtown**
   - tall buildings;
   - offices;
   - shops;
   - intersections;
   - alleys;
   - parking areas;
   - traffic lights.

2. **Residential / suburban**
   - houses;
   - apartments;
   - yards;
   - smaller roads;
   - convenience stores;
   - parks.

3. **Industrial district**
   - warehouses;
   - factories;
   - rail/utility areas;
   - storage yards;
   - shipping containers.

4. **Port / docks**
   - water;
   - cranes/industrial props;
   - warehouses;
   - boats;
   - piers.

5. **Beach / coastline**
   - beach;
   - promenade;
   - coastal roads;
   - vegetation.

6. **Airport**
   - runways;
   - hangars;
   - service roads;
   - planes/helicopters;
   - open takeoff/landing space.

7. **Countryside**
   - fields;
   - rural roads;
   - farms;
   - sparse buildings.

8. **Mountain / hill region**
   - winding roads;
   - trails;
   - viewpoints;
   - forests.

9. **Highway network**
   - multi-lane roads;
   - ramps;
   - bridges;
   - tunnels where practical.

Add additional variety if possible:
- river;
- lake/reservoir;
- desert/dry region;
- forest;
- luxury neighborhood;
- commercial strip;
- police station;
- hospital;
- gas stations;
- parking garages.

The world must be original and not recreate Los Santos or any real GTA map.

---

# 8. World streaming and performance

A large world requires deliberate technical architecture.

Use a scalable approach such as:
- World Partition;
- streaming sources centered around player/vehicles;
- HLOD;
- Data Layers where useful;
- Level Instances / modular sub-level organization where useful;
- distance-based activation;
- Nanite/HLOD/LOD strategy;
- Unreal occlusion/frustum culling;
- Instanced Static Mesh / Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh components for repeated static/decorative geometry;
- pooled traffic/pedestrians;
- spawn/despawn rings around the player;
- impostors/billboards only where visually acceptable;
- asynchronous loading where practical.

Do not keep the entire high-detail city fully active if unnecessary.

Consider floating-origin or precision mitigation only if map scale genuinely requires it.

The game should remain usable while screen recording.

---

# 9. Environment asset pipeline

Use Blender MCP to create **modular realistic environment kits** rather than individually hand-modeling every building from scratch.

Create reusable Blender collections/assets for:

### Buildings
- modern office façade modules;
- apartment modules;
- suburban house kit;
- storefront modules;
- industrial warehouse kit;
- airport/hangar kit;
- garage/parking structures.

### Street assets
- traffic lights;
- street lamps;
- traffic signs;
- barriers;
- benches;
- bins;
- fire hydrants;
- bus stops;
- fences;
- utility boxes;
- bollards;
- road cones.

### Roads
Use Unreal tooling/code (for example Splines, PCG, Editor Utility/Python automation, Geometry Script, and generated meshes) for road layout where more efficient, but create necessary visual assets through Blender:
- curbs;
- barriers;
- signs;
- lamp posts;
- road furniture.

Use project-generated materials/decals for:
- asphalt;
- lane markings;
- dirt;
- oil;
- cracks;
- crosswalks;
- sidewalks.

### Nature
Create/use project-owned:
- trees;
- bushes;
- rocks;
- grass;
- roadside vegetation.

Prioritize realistic silhouettes and sensible LODs.

---

# 10. Player character

Default gameplay should be **third-person**, similar to modern open-world action games.

For Unreal, prefer a robust C++ Character/Pawn controller with SpringArmComponent + CameraComponent for third-person camera behavior. Use Enhanced Input. Use CharacterMovementComponent where it fits, extending it for crouch, swimming, stealth, cover and traversal.

Implement:
- walk;
- run;
- sprint;
- jump;
- crouch if practical;
- aim;
- shooting;
- melee;
- weapon switching;
- entering/exiting vehicles;
- swimming;
- falling;
- ragdoll/death;
- camera orbit;
- camera collision;
- shoulder aiming;
- smooth movement transitions.

Optional/high priority:
- first-person mode toggle.

## Character model

Use Blender MCP to create an original realistic/stylized-realistic human character.

Do not leave the final player as:
- Capsule;
- mannequin;
- primitive;
- low-poly Roblox-like body.

Create:
- head;
- torso;
- arms;
- hands;
- legs;
- shoes;
- clothing;
- basic facial features;
- realistic human proportions.

Rig it for gameplay.

Use Unreal Skeletal Meshes, Skeleton assets, Control Rig, IK Retargeter/IK Rig, Animation Blueprints, Montages, and procedural/physics-based animation where practical.

If fully bespoke realistic animation is too expensive, prefer:
- procedural animation;
- IK;
- code-driven locomotion;
- reusable animation layers;
over visibly broken custom animation.

---


# 10A. Cover, stealth, traversal and close-combat depth

GTA V's on-foot sandbox is not only running and shooting. Build a more complete action-game movement/combat layer.

## Cover system — high priority

Implement a contextual cover system that works with common world geometry:

- enter/exit cover near suitable walls, barriers, vehicles and low objects;
- standing and low-cover poses;
- move left/right while attached to cover;
- peek around corners and over low cover;
- aim out from cover;
- fire from cover;
- blind fire with reduced accuracy;
- move around compatible cover corners;
- smoothly leave cover when movement demands it;
- avoid camera clipping while in cover.

Police and hostile AI should also use cover where practical.

## Stealth mode

Implement a GTA-like stealth state:

- slower/quieter movement;
- reduced footstep/noise radius;
- lower detection likelihood when out of sight;
- stealth takedown from behind;
- suppressed weapons interact with detection/noise;
- NPC suspicion/detection should depend on line of sight, distance, noise and obvious hostile behavior.

Stealth should remain a sandbox option and must not create stealth missions.

## Traversal

Improve basic traversal with:

- jump;
- climb/vault over low obstacles;
- contextual mantle where practical;
- ladder climbing;
- dodge/roll while aiming if practical;
- fall/landing reactions;
- ragdoll when impact thresholds are exceeded.

Do not turn traversal into parkour. Keep it grounded and GTA-like.

## Melee

Expand melee beyond a single attack:

- light/standard strike;
- heavier strike or contextual finisher;
- block/dodge where practical;
- melee weapon support;
- knockdown;
- different reactions based on attack direction/strength.

---

# 11. NPC population

Create a living population system.

NPC types should include:
- ordinary pedestrians;
- drivers;
- police officers;
- armed police/tactical units;
- shop staff;
- optional criminals/gang-like hostile NPCs.

NPCs should:
- walk around;
- use sidewalks;
- cross roads where practical;
- react to traffic;
- react to collisions;
- panic when gunfire/explosions occur;
- flee from danger;
- call/react to police events where practical;
- drive vehicles;
- fight or defend themselves depending on type;
- ragdoll or react physically to impacts;
- despawn/respawn intelligently for performance.

Create multiple visual variants through Blender:
- male/female body variations;
- clothing variations;
- skin/hair variations;
- police uniforms;
- tactical variants.

Do not make every NPC visually identical.

---

# 12. Traffic system

The city should contain believable civilian traffic.

For pedestrians, use Unreal Navigation, AI Controllers, Behavior Trees/State Trees or Mass AI where useful. Vehicle traffic should primarily follow a project-owned road/lane graph or spline network rather than forcing car traffic onto pedestrian navigation.

Implement:
- road graph / lanes;
- intersections;
- traffic signals;
- traffic direction;
- vehicle following;
- stopping;
- basic collision avoidance;
- lane changes where practical;
- traffic density scaling;
- vehicle spawn/despawn around player;
- parked vehicles;
- honking/reaction hooks;
- accidents and stopped traffic handling where practical.

Traffic AI does not need perfect real-world autonomy, but should look believable during normal driving.

---

# 13. Vehicle system

Vehicles are a major headline feature.

Implement a reusable vehicle framework with:
- enter/exit;
- driver seat;
- camera;
- steering;
- throttle;
- brakes;
- reverse;
- handbrake;
- suspension;
- tire grip;
- speed;
- engine state;
- damage;
- collision;
- headlights;
- brake lights;
- engine audio hooks;
- horn;
- vehicle health;
- explosions/fire when heavily damaged if practical.

Use Unreal's Chaos Vehicles / Chaos physics or another reliable project-owned vehicle implementation, with physically plausible suspension, tire forces, drivetrain and collision response.

## Vehicle classes

Create multiple distinct Blender-authored vehicles.

Minimum high-priority set:

### Cars
- compact car;
- sedan;
- sports car;
- muscle car;
- SUV;
- pickup;
- van;
- police cruiser.

### Two-wheel
- motorcycle;
- bicycle if practical.

### Water
- speedboat or motorboat.

### Air
- civilian helicopter;
- police helicopter;
- small propeller airplane;
- jet or fast airplane as stretch.

### Additional stretch
- truck;
- taxi;
- ambulance;
- fire truck;
- armored/police tactical vehicle.

Do not simply scale the same mesh to fake every vehicle category.

Use distinct silhouettes and handling profiles.

---


# 13A. Carjacking, drive-by combat and vehicle interaction

Vehicle gameplay must include the interactions that make a GTA-style sandbox feel complete.

## Carjacking

Support:

- entering an empty vehicle normally;
- pulling a civilian driver out of an occupied vehicle;
- NPC driver reaction/panic/fight-back depending on personality;
- theft of an occupied vehicle counting as a crime when witnessed;
- police vehicle theft causing an immediate serious response;
- motorcycles/bicycles using suitable contextual enter/steal animations.

The system may use simplified procedural transitions if full authored animations are not feasible, but it should not feel like instant teleportation when a visible character is in the seat.

## Drive-by shooting

Allow context-appropriate weapons while driving/riding:

- pistols;
- compact SMG-type weapons;
- throwable explosives where implemented;
- suitable one-handed weapons.

Implement:

- free aim from vehicle;
- camera support while aiming;
- reduced accuracy compared with standing fire;
- driver weapon restrictions;
- motorcycle forward/side firing;
- AI police/hostile drivers or passengers using vehicle weapons when appropriate.

## Vehicle detail interactions

Where practical support:

- headlights;
- high/low lights or simple toggle;
- brake lights;
- reverse lights;
- horn;
- siren for emergency vehicles;
- convertible roof on compatible cars;
- doors opening/closing;
- trunk/hood interaction as stretch;
- seat-specific entry points.

---

# 14. Vehicle Blender requirements

Major vehicles must be authored through `blender_unreal`.

For each important vehicle, create:
- body shell;
- wheels;
- glass;
- lights;
- interior approximation;
- steering wheel where visible;
- separate wheel objects;
- correctly placed pivots/origins;
- realistic scale;
- material slots;
- collision-friendly structure.

Material families:
- painted metal;
- glass;
- rubber;
- chrome/metal;
- plastic;
- interior fabric/leather;
- emissive headlights/taillights.

For important hero cars, improve visible quality beyond a simple box with wheels.

Create LOD-friendly geometry where practical.

---


# 14A. Vehicle customization and repair shop — high priority

Create an original in-world vehicle modification/repair garage inspired by the general functionality of GTA V's car customization system.

It must not copy Los Santos Customs branding, UI, logos or shop design.

The player should be able to drive a compatible vehicle into the shop and:

## Repair
- restore vehicle health;
- repair broken glass/lights where represented;
- restore handling damage.

## Cosmetic customization
Support as many as practical:

- primary paint;
- secondary paint;
- gloss/matte/metallic-style finishes;
- wheels/rims;
- wheel color;
- window tint;
- bumpers;
- hood;
- roof options;
- grille;
- exhaust;
- skirts;
- spoiler;
- lights;
- horn;
- license plate style;
- optional livery/stripe variants.

## Performance customization
Make upgrades genuinely affect handling/performance:

- engine tuning;
- brakes;
- suspension;
- transmission;
- turbo/forced-induction-like upgrade;
- armor;
- tire durability / bullet-resistant tire option;
- spoiler/downforce tuning where appropriate.

Use data-driven upgrade definitions.

Visual body modifications should use Blender-authored modular parts or carefully designed mesh variants rather than simply changing scale.

The benchmark/debug menu may unlock everything immediately, but normal free-roam purchases should cost in-game money.

---

# 15. Aircraft and helicopter gameplay

## Helicopters

Implement:
- takeoff/landing;
- collective/lift;
- yaw;
- pitch/roll;
- forward flight;
- responsive arcade-realistic controls;
- third-person chase camera;
- damage/crash.

## Airplanes

Implement:
- throttle;
- takeoff;
- pitch;
- roll;
- yaw;
- stall/low-speed degradation at least approximately;
- landing;
- crash/damage.

Controls can be accessible/arcade-like rather than flight-simulator complex.

Airport runways must support meaningful flight gameplay.

---

# 16. Boats and swimming

Implement:
- swimmable water;
- player buoyancy/swim controls;
- drowning/health consequences if useful;
- boats with buoyancy-like motion;
- entering/exiting boats;
- coastal/port gameplay.

Water should visually fit the realism target.

---

# 17. Weapons and combat

Create a substantial weapon system.

High-priority weapon categories:

### Melee
- fists;
- knife or melee weapon;
- bat/crowbar-like weapon.

### Handguns
- pistol;
- heavy pistol/revolver-like variant.

### SMG
- compact SMG.

### Shotguns
- pump shotgun;
- optional semi-auto shotgun.

### Rifles
- assault rifle;
- carbine;
- marksman rifle.

### Sniper
- sniper rifle with scoped aiming.

### Heavy/explosive
- grenade;
- rocket launcher;
- optional grenade launcher.

Do not copy GTA weapon models or brand names.

Use original generic weapon designs.

## Weapon behavior

Implement:
- weapon equip;
- weapon wheel or fast selection;
- ammo;
- magazines;
- reload;
- recoil;
- bullet spread;
- fire rate;
- hitscan/projectiles as appropriate;
- muzzle flash;
- shell/effect hooks;
- hit reactions;
- headshot/damage zones where practical;
- explosions;
- camera shake;
- aim zoom;
- scoped view for sniper.

Use Blender MCP to create proper 3D weapon models.

Do not use primitive cubes as final guns.

---


# 17A. Weapon customization and combat presentation

Create a weapon modification layer for compatible firearms.

At an original weapon shop/workbench, allow combinations such as:

- extended magazines;
- suppressor;
- flashlight;
- optic/scope;
- grip/stability upgrade where appropriate;
- cosmetic finish/tint;
- optional higher-capacity magazine for selected weapons.

Modifications must have actual gameplay effects when relevant:

- suppressor reduces audible detection radius but may slightly affect weapon balance;
- scope changes aiming/FOV;
- grip reduces recoil/spread;
- extended magazine increases capacity;
- flashlight illuminates dark environments while aiming.

## Ballistic interaction

Add practical material response:

- sparks on metal;
- dust/chips on concrete;
- glass breaking;
- decals or impact marks where performant;
- different impact audio hooks.

Stretch:
- limited penetration through thin materials;
- tire puncture from bullets;
- vehicle glass damage.

---

# 18. Police and wanted system — mandatory

This is one of the most important systems.

Implement a **0–5 level wanted/pursuit system**.

The player begins at:

```text
0 stars
```

Crimes increase wanted pressure.

Possible crime sources:
- attacking civilians;
- killing NPCs;
- shooting in public;
- attacking police;
- stealing occupied vehicles;
- major collisions;
- explosions;
- destroying police vehicles;
- continued resistance/arrests avoided.

Use witnesses/visibility where practical so not every crime instantly becomes globally known.

## Wanted levels

### 1 star
- nearby patrol responds;
- officers pursue/investigate.

### 2 stars
- more police cars;
- more aggressive pursuit;
- armed response.

### 3 stars
- larger vehicle response;
- roadblocks;
- police helicopter/search support if practical.

### 4 stars
- tactical/heavily armed units;
- stronger roadblocks;
- aggressive helicopter support.

### 5 stars
- maximum pursuit;
- many units;
- tactical vehicles/teams;
- sustained air support;
- difficult escape.

The exact numbers can be tuned for playability.

## Search / escape behavior

The wanted system should not simply be a timer.

Implement:
- police line of sight;
- last-known position;
- search radius/area;
- pursuing state;
- searching state;
- cooldown;
- stars decay when player remains unseen long enough.

Changing vehicle or hiding should help if police genuinely lose visual contact.

HUD must clearly show wanted level.

---


# 18A. Wanted-system refinements from GTA-style free roam

Strengthen the wanted system beyond simple star accumulation.

## Witnesses

Crimes should not always instantly become magically known.

When practical:

- civilians who directly witness a serious crime may panic and call police;
- if the player stops/escapes before a report completes, response may be delayed or prevented;
- gunshots/explosions can create an indirect report radius;
- police who directly see the crime report it immediately.

Do not make this system so complex that it destabilizes core police response.

## Active pursuit vs search state

Clearly separate:

### Pursuit
Police currently see/track the player.

### Search
Police have lost direct sight and search based on last known location.

During Search:
- wanted stars flash or otherwise visually communicate loss of direct contact;
- minimap shows nearby police/search directions or cones when practical;
- entering a police line of sight immediately resumes pursuit;
- escape timer progresses only while genuinely unseen.

Higher wanted levels should require a longer successful escape.

## Police vehicle tactics

Add GTA-like pursuit tactics where practical:

- PIT maneuver attempts;
- boxing-in at low speed;
- ramming from suitable angles;
- roadblocks at higher levels;
- spike strips as stretch;
- officers commandeering nearby civilian vehicles if stranded as stretch.

## Appearance / vehicle changes

During Search, changing obvious appearance or abandoning a clearly identified vehicle may slightly help the player evade detection.

Do not make it an instant universal wanted-clear button.

## Busted state

Police do not always need to kill the player.

If the player is:
- unarmed/not actively resisting;
- cornered at close range;
- or otherwise in an arrestable state,

allow a simplified **BUSTED/arrest** outcome.

On arrest:
- fade/respawn;
- clear wanted level;
- apply a modest money/ammo penalty if desired.

This should coexist with the death/respawn system.

---

# 19. Police AI

Police should:
- investigate crimes;
- pursue player;
- use vehicles;
- exit vehicles;
- aim/shoot when escalation warrants it;
- seek nearby positions/cover approximately;
- call/spawn reinforcements;
- create roadblocks at higher wanted levels;
- use helicopter support where implemented;
- attempt to surround/intercept rather than only drive directly into the player.

Do not spawn police directly in the player's visible field of view if avoidable.

---

# 20. Combat AI

Hostile NPCs should support:
- target selection;
- line of sight;
- firing;
- reloading;
- movement;
- basic cover use if practical;
- flanking/position changes as stretch;
- melee at close range where appropriate;
- death/ragdoll;
- surrender/fleeing behavior for civilians.

The player's combat should remain responsive even with many AI actors nearby.

---

# 21. Physics and reactions

Use physics to create convincing sandbox interactions.

Implement where practical:
- ragdolls;
- vehicle impacts;
- destructible light props;
- movable street objects;
- explosions applying force;
- NPC knockdown;
- vehicle-to-NPC impact reactions;
- damaged vehicle handling;
- broken street furniture;
- fire/explosion chain reactions for vehicles.

Do not attempt expensive full-building destruction if it compromises the project.

---

# 22. Vehicle damage

Vehicles should visibly and mechanically react to damage.

At minimum:
- health/durability;
- collision damage;
- smoke at heavy damage;
- fire before destruction if practical;
- eventual explosion/destruction;
- damaged handling.

Stretch:
- detachable doors/hood;
- broken glass;
- damaged lights;
- wheel damage;
- limited deformation.

A simple but convincing damage model is better than unstable full soft-body simulation.

---

# 23. World interactions

The player should be able to interact with the sandbox beyond shooting/driving.

High-priority:
- enter/exit vehicles;
- steal occupied vehicles;
- pick up weapons/ammo;
- buy/get weapons;
- use shops;
- interact with doors/use points;
- use garages/vehicle spawn points;
- swim;
- climb simple ladders if practical;
- use elevators/automatic doors where useful.

Optional:
- basic clothing change;
- vehicle repair;
- body armor purchase;
- food/health purchase.

No missions or quests.

---


# 23A. Player customization, safehouses, phone and personal services

Add free-roam identity/lifestyle systems that make the world feel closer to a complete GTA-style sandbox.

## Clothing

Create original clothing stores or wardrobe interaction with a modest but visible set of:

- shirts/jackets;
- pants;
- shoes;
- hats;
- glasses/accessories.

Use Blender-authored modular clothing or material variants where practical.

Clothing is cosmetic and must not become a mission requirement.

## Hair / appearance

Add a barber/salon-like interaction as stretch:

- hair variants;
- facial-hair variants;
- simple appearance options.

A tattoo shop is a lower-priority stretch feature.

## Safehouse

Provide at least one usable safehouse/home with:

- save/respawn role;
- wardrobe access;
- garage access;
- optional sleep/time-skip;
- basic interior.

## Garages / stored vehicles

Support storing a small set of player-selected vehicles persistently.

A stored/personal vehicle should be retrievable after loading when practical.

## Smartphone / interaction device

Create an original in-game phone or interaction interface for free-roam utility.

Useful functions may include:

- contacts/services;
- call/request taxi;
- camera/photo mode;
- quick save;
- vehicle/garage service;
- basic map/waypoint access.

Do not recreate GTA's exact phone UI or brands.

---

# 24. Economy and shops

Implement a lightweight free-roam economy.

Player has:
- cash balance;
- weapon shop purchases;
- ammo purchases;
- armor/health purchases where appropriate;
- vehicle repair or garage costs if implemented.

Because there are no missions, provide multiple sandbox-compatible ways to obtain/test money:
- initial reasonable cash;
- NPC cash drops where appropriate;
- pickups;
- debug/cheat controls;
- optional store robbery/emergent crime interaction as stretch.

Do not make economy grind block testing.

---

# 25. Weapon shop

Create at least one interactable weapon store.

It should allow buying:
- handguns;
- SMGs;
- shotguns;
- rifles;
- ammo;
- armor if implemented.

Use an original store identity and original UI.

---

# 26. Garage / vehicle access

Provide a convenient way to access vehicles for free-roam testing.

Possible implementations:
- garages;
- parking lots;
- dealership;
- debug/admin spawn menu.

The player must not be forced to search the whole map just to demonstrate a helicopter or airplane.

---

# 27. Day/night cycle

Implement:
- time-of-day cycle;
- sunrise;
- daylight;
- sunset;
- night;
- street lights;
- vehicle headlights;
- building/window lighting where practical;
- nighttime traffic/pedestrian variation if practical.

Visual quality at night matters.

---

# 28. Weather

Implement several weather states:

- clear;
- cloudy;
- rain;
- fog;
- storm if practical.

Weather should affect presentation:
- sky;
- lighting;
- wet-looking surfaces if possible;
- visibility;
- rain particles;
- reflections where supported.

Stretch:
- reduced vehicle grip in rain.

---

# 29. Map navigation

Implement a useful minimap/HUD navigation system.

At minimum:
- minimap or radar;
- player heading;
- roads or simplified map representation;
- police/wanted feedback;
- major world locations.

Stretch:
- full-screen map;
- waypoint;
- simple GPS route line.

No mission markers.

---


# 29A. Public transport, parachuting, underwater exploration and wildlife

These systems are high-value free-roam mechanics because they make the map feel like a world rather than a combat arena.

## Taxi passenger service

Allow the player to:

- hail/call a taxi;
- enter as a passenger;
- choose a map destination;
- ride there normally;
- optionally skip/fast-forward the trip after a short transition.

Taxi driving as a paid side activity is optional and should remain a free-roam activity, not a mission chain.

## Trains / transit

If technically practical, include:

- moving trains and/or subway;
- player can board/ride at least one transit type;
- trains follow fixed routes;
- collisions are handled safely.

## Parachute

Implement a usable parachute system:

- equip automatically or from inventory when available;
- deploy after jumping/falling;
- steer;
- descend;
- flare/slow for landing;
- landing damage for bad landings;
- altimeter while parachuting if useful.

Place parachutes at suitable high locations and/or aircraft so free-roam jumps are easy to test.

## Underwater / diving

Expand swimming with:

- diving below surface;
- breath/lung capacity;
- underwater camera/fog/audio treatment;
- deeper coastal areas;
- underwater props/wreck-like exploration areas;
- optional scuba gear that enables much longer underwater exploration.

## Wildlife

Populate suitable non-urban regions with a limited but convincing wildlife system.

Examples:
- deer;
- coyotes;
- boar;
- rabbits;
- birds;
- farm animals;
- dogs/cats;
- fish;
- sharks or another dangerous marine animal.

Animals should use simple ecosystem-appropriate behavior:
- grazing/wandering;
- fleeing;
- predators attacking only where appropriate;
- aquatic movement;
- region-based spawning.

Keep counts performance-conscious.

---

# 30. HUD

Create a polished GTA-like-but-original HUD.

Implement UI with UMG and project-owned widget classes/styles. CommonUI may be used if already available and it improves scalability. Avoid fragile hard-coded screen coordinates when anchors/layout containers are more appropriate.

Display as appropriate:
- health;
- armor;
- ammo;
- selected weapon;
- wanted stars;
- money;
- minimap;
- vehicle speed;
- vehicle health indicator if useful.

Do not copy GTA V's exact HUD artwork.

Create an original modern interface.

---

# 31. Weapon wheel

Implement a weapon-selection interface inspired by the general radial-selection concept used in modern action games.

It may:
- slow time while open;
- organize weapon classes;
- show ammo;
- allow quick mouse/controller selection.

Do not copy exact GTA V artwork.

---

# 32. Camera

Third-person camera should feel polished.

Implement:
- smooth follow;
- orbit;
- collision avoidance;
- aim camera;
- vehicle chase camera;
- vehicle look-around;
- helicopter/plane chase camera;
- camera shake;
- field-of-view tuning.

Optional:
- first-person toggle for player and vehicles.

---

# 33. Controls

Create sensible default keyboard/mouse controls.

Suggested defaults:

```text
WASD             Move / vehicle control
Mouse            Camera / aim
Left Shift       Sprint
Space            Jump / handbrake in vehicle depending context
Ctrl/C           Crouch if implemented
F                Enter/exit vehicle
Left Mouse       Fire / melee attack
Right Mouse      Aim
R                Reload
1-9 / wheel      Weapon selection
Tab              Weapon wheel
E                Interact
M                Map
Esc              Pause
V                Camera toggle
H                Horn where context-appropriate
```

Use context-sensitive controls where practical.

Add controller support only after keyboard/mouse is stable.

---

# 34. Audio

Do not use copyrighted GTA/RDR audio or music.

Use Unreal Audio Components, Sound Cues/MetaSounds, attenuation settings, submixes and generated/project-owned audio resources.

Create original/project-owned audio where practical:
- footsteps;
- gunshots;
- reloads;
- impacts;
- explosions;
- vehicle engines;
- tires/skids;
- horn;
- sirens;
- helicopter;
- ambient city;
- ocean;
- rain;
- UI.

If realistic audio generation is not possible with available tools, create simple original procedural/synthesized audio rather than copying commercial assets.

Audio quality is important, but do not block gameplay progress on perfect sound design.

---

# 35. Vehicle audio

Vehicles should have convincing feedback:
- engine pitch by RPM/speed;
- acceleration;
- braking/skid;
- impact;
- horn;
- police sirens;
- helicopter rotor;
- airplane engine.

Procedurally generated audio is acceptable.

---


# 35A. Emergency-world response and ambient services

Make the sandbox react to incidents beyond only police.

Where practical:

- ambulances respond to serious NPC injuries/deaths;
- fire trucks respond to major fires/explosions;
- emergency vehicles use sirens and traffic attempts to yield;
- responders despawn intelligently when far from the player;
- tow/service vehicle behavior is a stretch feature.

These systems are atmospheric. Do not let them overwhelm performance or interfere with the wanted system.

## Radio / in-vehicle media

Create an original radio/media system as a stretch feature.

Requirements:
- station/channel selection wheel or cycling;
- vehicle audio source;
- original/project-owned music or procedural audio only;
- no copyrighted commercial tracks;
- remember last selected station when practical.

A simple set of distinct original ambient stations is enough for the benchmark.

---

# 36. World ambience

Add environmental life:
- distant city noise;
- vehicle sounds;
- ambient pedestrian chatter-like nonverbal noise where possible;
- wind;
- coastal ambience;
- rain;
- industrial ambience.

Do not use copyrighted recordings.

---

# 37. Save/load

Implement basic persistence using Unreal's SaveGame framework and project-owned serializable data structures.

Save at least:
- player position;
- health/armor;
- money;
- owned/purchased weapons;
- ammo;
- current time;
- basic settings;
- optional last vehicle/garage state.

The game should recover gracefully if some dynamic world objects are not persisted.

---

# 38. Admin / benchmark menu — mandatory

Create a hidden or explicit benchmark/debug menu for rapid YouTube testing.

It must allow:
- teleport to key districts;
- spawn any implemented vehicle;
- spawn helicopter;
- spawn airplane;
- spawn boat;
- give any implemented weapon;
- refill ammo;
- set money;
- set health/armor;
- set wanted level 0–5;
- clear wanted level;
- spawn police;
- set time;
- set weather;
- repair current vehicle;
- open/test vehicle customization;
- unlock all vehicle modification options;
- give parachute;
- refill lung capacity / toggle scuba for testing;
- max/reset character skills;
- call taxi;
- toggle wildlife;
- toggle invulnerability;
- toggle traffic;
- toggle pedestrians;
- show FPS;
- show coordinates/sector.

This is a testing tool, not a mission system.

It should make it easy to demonstrate the whole project on video.

---

# 39. Blender project organization

Inside `UnrealGTA.blend`, organize major assets into clear collections such as:

```text
GTA_UNREAL
  Characters
  NPCs
  Vehicles
    Cars
    Motorcycles
    Boats
    Helicopters
    Airplanes
  Weapons
  Buildings
  StreetProps
  Interiors
  Nature
  VFX_HelperMeshes
  CollisionHelpers
```

Use consistent naming.

Avoid thousands of unnamed objects such as:

```text
Cube.001
Cube.002
Cube.003
```

for final assets.

---

# 40. Unreal Engine asset/code organization

Organize project content clearly, for example:

```text
Source/
  GTA/
    Core/
    Player/
    Vehicles/
    Traffic/
    AI/
    Police/
    Weapons/
    Combat/
    World/
    Streaming/
    UI/
    Audio/
    Save/
    Debug/
    Editor/

Content/
  GTA/
    Characters/
    Vehicles/
    Weapons/
    World/
      Buildings/
      Roads/
      Props/
      Nature/
      Interiors/
    Materials/
    Textures/
    Animations/
    UI/
    VFX/
    Audio/
    Data/
    Generated/
    Maps/
```

Use Data Assets/Data Tables and Gameplay Tags where appropriate.

Use Blueprint child classes primarily as data/configuration/visual composition layers on top of reusable C++ gameplay classes.

Keep generated/automated content in predictable folders.

Adapt this structure to the existing project/module names rather than renaming everything unnecessarily.


---

# 41. Blender export pipeline

Create a reproducible Blender → Unreal Engine pipeline.

Preferred flow:

```text
UnrealGTA.blend
→ Blender MCP edits
→ save source
→ export FBX/GLB as appropriate
→ SourceAssets/BlenderExports/... (or another clearly separated source-export folder)
→ Unreal Editor Python / automated import
→ /Game/GTA/Generated/...
→ material assignment
→ StaticMesh/SkeletalMesh configuration
→ Blueprint/Data Asset integration
→ gameplay integration
```

Preferred interchange:

- **FBX** for skeletal meshes, characters, rigged vehicles/parts and animation clips when reliable;
- FBX or glTF/GLB for static meshes based on which pipeline validates best in the installed UE5 build.

For static meshes:
- validate scale/orientation;
- generate/configure collision where appropriate;
- enable Nanite only when useful;
- create LODs only where still beneficial;
- validate material slots.

For skeletal meshes:
- preserve skeleton/armature;
- validate bone orientation;
- create/import animation clips when appropriate;
- configure Physics Asset where useful;
- configure IK Rig / Retargeter if needed.

Do not rely on manually importing every asset through the Content Browser.

Use Unreal Editor Python/C++ tooling to automate imports, paths, collision settings, material assignment and derived Blueprint creation where practical.

Do not depend on direct runtime use of the master `.blend` file. `UnrealGTA.blend` is the editable source; exported files and imported Unreal assets are the runtime artifacts.


---

# 42. Materials and textures

Create realistic materials without relying on external copyrighted texture packs.

Use:
- Blender procedural materials;
- baked procedural textures;
- project-generated textures;
- Unreal Material/Material Instance systems, Substrate if appropriate, and generated texture assets.

Important material families:
- asphalt;
- concrete;
- brick;
- painted plaster;
- glass;
- metal;
- chrome;
- car paint;
- rubber;
- leather;
- cloth;
- skin;
- hair;
- wood;
- vegetation;
- dirt;
- sand;
- rock;
- water.

Create:
- base color;
- roughness;
- metallic;
- normal/bump;
- AO where useful.

Use texture atlases or trim sheets for modular buildings where efficient.

---

# 43. LODs, Nanite, HLOD and instancing

Create an appropriate scalable rendering strategy for:
- vehicles;
- buildings;
- trees;
- street props;
- NPCs.

Use:
- Nanite for suitable high-detail static environment assets;
- HLOD for World Partition cells/large environment groupings;
- LODs for skeletal meshes, vehicles and assets where Nanite is not appropriate;
- Instanced Static Mesh / Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh components for repeated props/vegetation;
- distance culling where useful.

Do not render every high-detail asset at full cost across the entire city.


---

# 44. Lighting

Lighting should strongly support realism.

Prioritize:
- believable sun direction/intensity;
- soft outdoor ambience;
- night lighting;
- street lights;
- emissive signs/windows;
- headlights;
- police lights;
- interior shop lighting;
- volumetric atmosphere where supported.

Avoid flat default-editor lighting.

---

# 45. VFX

Create useful effects for:
- muzzle flashes;
- bullet impacts;
- sparks;
- dust;
- explosions;
- fire;
- smoke;
- vehicle damage;
- rain;
- water splashes;
- tire smoke;
- skid effects;
- helicopter dust;
- police lights.

Use Unreal-native VFX systems such as:
- Niagara;
- Decals;
- Material Parameter Collections;
- dynamic lights where appropriate;
- camera shake;
- post-process feedback.

Keep common effects pooled/reusable and performance-conscious.


---

# 46. Interaction quality

Add feedback so systems feel intentional:
- enter vehicle animation/transition;
- weapon equip;
- reload;
- recoil;
- hit reactions;
- vehicle impact feedback;
- police sirens;
- screen feedback for low health;
- subtle camera effects;
- pickup feedback;
- UI sounds.

Avoid excessive arcade UI if it harms realism.

---


# 46A. Character skill progression

Add a lightweight use-based character-stat system inspired by GTA V's single-player attributes.

High-value skills:

- **Stamina** — improves sustained sprinting/cycling/swimming.
- **Shooting** — modestly improves recoil control/reload handling.
- **Strength** — improves melee performance and physical resilience.
- **Stealth** — improves quiet movement/detection profile.
- **Driving** — improves difficult vehicle control/recovery slightly.
- **Flying** — reduces turbulence/handling penalties and improves aircraft control slightly.
- **Lung Capacity** — increases underwater breath time.

Skills should improve primarily by doing the relevant activity.

Keep benefits noticeable but not so strong that low-skill gameplay feels broken.

Expose current stats in a pause/status screen or debug menu.

The system is free-roam progression and must not create mission prerequisites.

---

# 47. World activities — but NO missions

Do not implement missions.

Allowed free-roam activities/interactions include:
- driving;
- flying;
- boating;
- shooting;
- police chases;
- shops;
- garage/vehicle spawning;
- swimming;
- exploration;
- stunts;
- emergent traffic accidents;
- fighting;
- changing time/weather through debug tools;
- sandbox destruction.

Do **not** add:
- mission start markers;
- quest objectives;
- NPC quest givers;
- story cutscenes;
- campaign progression;
- scripted heists;
- mission rewards.

---


# 47A. Optional hobbies and free-roam activities

GTA V contains many activities that are not part of the core story. Add a **small selection only after the primary sandbox is stable**.

These are optional stretch goals and must not become quests/missions.

Good candidates:

- shooting range;
- street race;
- off-road race;
- sea race;
- time trial;
- parachute/base-jump challenge;
- triathlon;
- golf putting/driving-range style activity;
- tennis;
- darts;
- stunt jumps.

Implementation rule:

- activities begin only when the player deliberately interacts with an activity point;
- no story dialogue/campaign progression;
- simple score/time/reward is acceptable;
- do not spend core-development time implementing all of them before police, traffic, vehicles and combat are stable.

## Shooting range

Highest priority among activities because it reuses the combat system.

Support:
- timed target sequences;
- score;
- accuracy;
- optional small cash reward;
- contributes to Shooting skill.

## Stunt jumps

Place optional stunt locations around the map.

Track:
- successful jump;
- distance/airtime;
- safe landing.

This adds exploration value without requiring missions.

---

# 48. Difficulty and player survivability

Implement:
- health;
- armor;
- damage;
- fall damage;
- vehicle collision damage;
- bullets;
- explosions;
- drowning if appropriate;
- death/respawn.

On death:
- fade/death UI;
- respawn at a sensible location/hospital-like respawn point;
- reset wanted level;
- preserve basic sandbox access.

---

# 49. Performance targets

The project must remain playable.

Avoid:
- one ticking Actor/Component per tiny prop where unnecessary;
- thousands of unpooled traffic/NPC objects;
- expensive AI for distant entities;
- rendering all interiors;
- heavy per-frame reflection updates everywhere;
- all vehicles/NPCs simulating across the full map;
- unbounded rigidbodies.

Use:
- pooling;
- distance-based simulation tiers;
- LOD;
- streaming;
- simplified distant AI;
- culled interiors;
- sensible traffic/pedestrian caps.

Prefer stable 30–60 FPS at reasonable recording settings over theoretical ultra graphics that are unusable.

---

# 50. AI simulation tiers

Use simulation levels:

### Near player
Full:
- animation;
- physics;
- driving;
- combat;
- reactions.

### Medium distance
Reduced:
- simplified AI;
- limited updates.

### Far distance
Represented minimally or despawned.

This is especially important for:
- pedestrians;
- civilian traffic;
- police units.

---

# 51. Priority order

This project is extremely broad.

Use this implementation priority:

1. stable Unreal Engine project;
2. player + camera;
3. large streamed world foundation;
4. one polished Blender-authored car + enter/drive/exit;
5. traffic foundation;
6. player weapon/combat foundation;
7. NPC/pedestrian foundation;
8. police + wanted system;
9. broaden vehicle roster;
10. large varied map;
11. helicopters/airplanes/boats;
12. broaden weapon roster;
13. vehicle customization/repair;
14. shops/economy/player customization;
15. cover/stealth/drive-by polish;
16. day/night/weather;
17. better NPC reactions and witness behavior;
18. parachute/diving/wildlife/public transport;
19. vehicle damage/explosions;
20. realism/material/lighting pass;
21. character-stat progression;
22. selected free-roam activities;
23. additional world interaction;
24. benchmark/debug menu;
25. final QA and optimization.

Do **not** stop at step 4.

Continue adding working breadth for as long as the session allows.

---

# 52. Definition of a strong first milestone

A strong first milestone requires:

- player can walk in third person;
- a substantial city area exists;
- at least one realistic Blender-authored car exists;
- player can enter/drive/exit it;
- basic traffic exists;
- at least one realistic Blender-authored firearm exists;
- player can shoot;
- pedestrians exist;
- police can respond;
- wanted stars work;
- basic UI works.

Once this is stable, continue expanding toward the full scope.

---

# 53. Do not fake breadth

Do not populate menus with 30 vehicles if only one actually works.

A feature may be marked:

```text
WORKING
PARTIAL
NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

Only mark `WORKING` if it has a functional in-game path.

For decorative-only assets, label them clearly.

---

# 54. QA workflow

Continuously:
- build the C++ project;
- inspect UnrealBuildTool/compiler output;
- inspect Unreal logs;
- fix C++/Blueprint/material/shader/import errors;
- load the main map;
- test gameplay;
- verify imported Blender assets;
- verify scale/orientation;
- verify collision;
- verify materials;
- verify SkeletalMesh/PhysicsAsset/animations;
- check broken asset references;
- validate World Partition streaming behavior.

Find the installed Unreal Engine path automatically if possible.

Use Unreal automation when helpful:
- Visual Studio/MSBuild/UnrealBuildTool;
- `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe`;
- Unreal Editor Python;
- commandlets;
- project-owned automation scripts;
- automation tests where practical.

Validate:
- C++ Editor target builds;
- required plugins load;
- maps open;
- Blueprint assets compile;
- shaders/materials compile;
- generated/imported assets resolve;
- project default map/game mode are valid.

Do not wait until the very end to discover that the project does not build or open.


---

# 55. Blender QA

Before accepting major assets:
- inspect silhouette;
- inspect proportions;
- inspect normals;
- inspect materials;
- check scale;
- check origin;
- check transforms;
- remove accidental duplicate geometry;
- check wheel pivots;
- check weapon grip/origin;
- check character rig orientation;
- check object names.

Then validate the exported result inside Unreal Engine.

---

# 58. Session timing, token accounting and API-equivalent cost — mandatory

These metrics will be shown in the YouTube comparison between the three engine versions, so collect them carefully and **do not fabricate precision**.

## 58.1 Development time

At the very beginning of the task, before substantial development work:

1. Read the current local timestamp from the operating system.
2. Save it to:
   ```text
   .astra-run/start_time.txt
   ```
3. Preserve that timestamp for the final report.

At the end of the task:

1. Read the current local timestamp again.
2. Save it to:
   ```text
   .astra-run/end_time.txt
   ```
3. Calculate the full wall-clock elapsed time.

The timer includes:
- planning;
- coding;
- Blender MCP work;
- model creation;
- exports/imports;
- Unreal C++ build, asset import, shader compilation, map loading and runtime validation;
- testing;
- debugging;
- asset generation;
- waiting for builds/imports/commands during this autonomous session.

Report:
- start timestamp;
- end timestamp;
- elapsed time as `HH:MM:SS`;
- elapsed minutes;
- elapsed hours as a decimal if useful.

Do not estimate development duration from memory if timestamps are available.

## 58.2 Token usage

At the end, make a best effort to obtain **real token usage for this Codex/Astra session**.

Preferred sources, in order:

1. session/runtime usage telemetry exposed directly by Codex;
2. Codex session status/usage data;
3. the current Codex session log/JSONL under the user's Codex data directory if accessible;
4. another official local session-usage source.

Identify the correct current session carefully using:
- working directory;
- timestamps;
- session ID;
- recent activity.

Where available, report separately:

- input tokens;
- cached input tokens;
- cache-write tokens;
- output tokens;
- reasoning tokens if reported separately;
- total tokens.

Important:
- determine whether usage records are **per-turn** or **cumulative** before adding them;
- do not double-count cumulative snapshots;
- do not count the same cached/cache-write tokens twice;
- do not invent token numbers merely to fill the report.

If exact token usage is unavailable, write exactly:

```text
Exact token usage unavailable from accessible runtime.
```

You may provide a clearly labeled estimate only if there is a defensible data source and method.

## 58.3 GPT-6 Astra API-equivalent price

Calculate the approximate **token-only API-equivalent cost in USD** for the work performed in this session.

This is **not** the user's actual ChatGPT/Codex subscription charge. It is a benchmark estimate answering:

> "What would this token usage have cost at GPT-6 Astra API token rates?"

If official current GPT-6 Astra API pricing is accessible from an authoritative OpenAI source at runtime, use the current official rates and record the source/rates used.

If live official pricing cannot be retrieved, use these benchmark rates for GPT-6 Astra:

```text
Uncached input:    $10.00 per 1M tokens
Cached input:       $1.00 per 1M tokens
Cache writes:      $12.50 per 1M tokens
Output:            $50.00 per 1M tokens
```

When the telemetry defines cached/cache-write tokens as subsets of total input, calculate non-cached input without double-counting:

```text
non_cached_input =
    input_tokens
  - cached_input_tokens
  - cache_write_tokens
```

Then calculate:

```text
token_cost_usd =
    (non_cached_input / 1,000,000 * 10.00)
  + (cached_input_tokens / 1,000,000 * 1.00)
  + (cache_write_tokens / 1,000,000 * 12.50)
  + (output_tokens / 1,000,000 * 50.00)
```

If the runtime reports token categories with different semantics, adapt the formula to those semantics and explain the adjustment.

### Long-context pricing

If the official GPT-6 Astra pricing applicable at runtime uses a long-context multiplier and you have **per-request/per-turn usage**, apply it accurately to the requests that cross the relevant threshold.

For the benchmark fallback pricing above, if a request has more than **272K input tokens**, use:

- 2× input/cache rates for that full request;
- 1.5× output rate for that full request.

If you have only aggregate session totals and cannot determine which individual requests crossed the threshold:
- report the standard-rate API-equivalent cost;
- state clearly that an exact long-context adjustment could not be reconstructed from aggregate totals;
- do not invent an adjusted value.

### Tool fees

If Blender MCP, local tools, Unreal Engine, or other local tool calls do not have a separately metered API fee, do not invent one.

If an external paid tool/API somehow becomes involved despite the project rules, report its fee separately rather than hiding it inside token cost.

Label the main number:

```text
GPT-6 Astra token-only API-equivalent cost
```

## 58.4 Required metrics in `ASTRA_FINAL_REPORT.md`

At the bottom of `ASTRA_FINAL_REPORT.md`, include exactly this section:

```text
## Astra Session Metrics

Start:
End:
Elapsed:
Elapsed minutes:
Elapsed hours:

Model:
Reasoning effort (if available):

Input tokens:
Cached input tokens:

GPT-6 Astra token-only API-equivalent cost:
Pricing rates/source used:

External tool/API fees included: No/Yes
Confidence / data source:

Blender MCP server used: blender_unreal
Blender port: 9878
Blender master file: UnrealGTA.blend
Approximate number of major Blender assets created:
```

The final response to me must also explicitly state:

1. total development time;
2. total token usage, if available;
3. GPT-6 Astra token-only API-equivalent price in USD, if calculable;
4. whether the figures are exact or estimated.

These metrics are mandatory for the benchmark and should be calculated only after the final validation pass.

# 59. Git / recovery

Use Git where practical.

Create meaningful milestone commits, for example:
- baseline;
- player;
- first drivable car;
- combat;
- police/wanted;
- world expansion;
- air vehicles;
- final stabilization.

Do not commit:
- `Binaries/`;
- `DerivedDataCache/`;
- `Intermediate/`;
- `Saved/`;
- packaged build outputs;
- large generated caches;
- other standard Unreal transient data.

Do not allow an experimental change to destroy the only working state.

# 60. Final asset-quality gate

Before final completion, visually inspect the game and explicitly reject obvious placeholder content.

Important visible content should **not** remain:
- raw Unreal primitive cubes/capsules/default placeholder meshes;
- capsules;
- default mannequin-like placeholders;
- untextured gray meshes;
- magenta missing materials;
- primitive cars;
- cube guns;
- low-poly toy buildings;
- identical NPCs.

Prioritize final replacement of:
1. player character;
2. main vehicles;
3. police;
4. common pedestrians;
5. weapons;
6. hero buildings/landmarks;
7. street props.

If some lower-priority distant assets remain simplified, document them honestly.

# 61. Final response

Do not finish by only saying "done".

Before responding:

1. run final validation;
2. fix critical parse/runtime errors;
3. inspect `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`;
4. update `ASTRA_FINAL_REPORT.md`;
5. save `UnrealGTA.blend`;
6. ensure exported Blender assets are imported into the Unreal project and load cleanly;
7. confirm the game launches into free roam;
8. confirm there are **no missions**;
9. confirm the admin/benchmark menu provides rapid access to implemented systems;
10. make a final Git commit if the repository is healthy.

Then provide a concise final summary with:

- how to launch;
- controls;
- map regions;
- vehicle list;
- weapon list;
- wanted/police features;
- Blender assets created;
- what remains incomplete;
- elapsed development time;
- token usage if available;
- GPT-6 Astra token-only API-equivalent cost in USD if calculable;
- whether the reported metrics are exact or estimated.

# 62. Start now

Begin immediately.

First:
- inspect the existing Unreal Engine project;
- verify `blender_unreal`;
- verify `UnrealGTA.blend`;
- record start time;
- assess render pipeline;
- create the implementation plan.

Then build the game autonomously.

Remember:

**This is a missionless, realistic, large open-world GTA-style free-roam sandbox.**

**Unreal Engine 5 is the game engine.**

**`blender_unreal` on port 9878 and `UnrealGTA.blend` are the mandatory Blender asset pipeline.**

**Use Blender actively, not merely as an optional export tool.**
